            <h2>Product Overview</h2>
            <p id="product-description">The 2767 M18 FUEL™ High Torque 1/2 in. Impact Wrench with Friction Ring eliminates the need to use a pneumatic tool for those stubborn and rusted bolts by delivering 1,000 ft-lbs of fastening torque and 1400 ft-lbs of nut-busting torque. With 2X faster removal speed, users will be able to get the job done faster and be more productive throughout their day. By providing the industry’s most compact cordless High Torque Impact Wrench at 8.39 in. in length, this tool allows for better access in tight spaces. 4-Mode DRIVE CONTROL™ with Bolt Removal mode gives users the most control over their fasteners. Bolt Removal mode gives the user more control when removing fasteners by slowing to 750 rpm once the fastener has been busted loose. This tool offers quick, tool-free socket changes with a 1/2 in. friction ring anvil. A premium rubber overmold material gives you ultimate comfort during prolonged use while lasting longer against corrosive materials.</p>

                    <h4>Worth every penny.</h4>
                    <p>I took the tool to the junk yard to test it's power. I did not find any bolt that I couldn't take off. I easily took off lug nuts from pickup trucks. I took off, with minimal effort, a rusted on 46 mm axle nut. I took off with no effort at all a 36 mm truck axle nut.
    So, for about an hour I took off anything that seemed to be impossible to take off with a regular ratchet and socket tool. After an hour of torture at the junk yard the battery was 90% full. I am extremely satisfied with the purchase.</p>

                    <p>Removed the lug nuts off of my 68 dump truck when my Ingersoll Rand 1 inch pneumatic impact gun couldn't. Absolutely love it. Milwaukee has taken battery powered tools to the next level!</p>

                    <h4>Super Skookum</h4>
                    <p>This is a powerhouse that far exceeds my old air impact driver. Can't believe the power that an 18-volt battery can deliver. Tim Allen would have given this the old primeval grunt; Arrrrgh Arrrrgh Arrrrgh.</p>
